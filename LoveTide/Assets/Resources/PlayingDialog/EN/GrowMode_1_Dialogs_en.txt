Oh, it's you, Manager! What can I do for you?
How's it going so far?
So far? It's okay, I guess—just my feet are killing me from standing all day.
Thank goodness you're here to look out for me, Manager. Otherwise, I'd never make it through...
Haha, I'm pretty dependable, right?
Yes, yes, yes~ You're the best, manager~
Chatted with Yuka for a bit. From our conversation, it seems the current workload might be a bit much for her.
So tired... Why is it taking so long to get off work...
Huh? Aren't you the manager!? Hard to imagine you saying something like that.
Sure, this is how I make my living, but I definitely want to clock out and rest just like everyone else, right?
I'm not some workaholic who pushes themselves to the bone all day.
True... And you probably have way more on your plate than us regular staff...
Of course. That's why after work, I always grab some yakitori and a cold beer to unwind. Want to join me sometime?
Yuka gave me an awkward yet polite smile. We'd only just met, so a polite refusal was totally understandable.
It's been ages since I hit the bars. Want to grab a drink? I can introduce you to some new folks. You're new around here, so building connections is always good.
But manager... we're not off yet...
No worries. Look at Xiao Ming over there—he's a workhorse, practically an emotionless part-timer. Leave it to him.
The manager's so ruthless~ Let's just focus on finishing our work together. We can go out together after we get off later~
Even though she seemed to agree, her answer was actually very vague. She's still holding back with me, isn't she?
The two of us stood at the counter, each busy with our own tasks...
Sigh~ There's always so much to do...
What can you do~ It's fine, just hang in there a little longer!
I can't take it anymore. No one will notice if I skip a day anyway.
I will! And what if the manager isn't here? What then?
What if we get a difficult customer, or even some creepy uncle who tries to grope me...
Fine, fine~ I'll stay here with you, okay?
Hehe~ Let's work hard together!
And so it continued—training the newbie while handling 1.5 times the workload.
I'm so sleepy... Oh my god...
Hmm... What time did the manager go to bed yesterday?
Must have been right on schedule at 2 AM!
Well, that's probably why she looks like that...
I want to sleep early too! But every time I think, “I finally got off work—how could I just go to sleep now?”
The result is obvious, heh. Does Yuka ever go to bed early?
Haha, no way! Looks like we're both night owls~
After a cute yawn, Yuka went back to her half-finished work.
Since you came to this island, have you gone out to eat, drink, and play around?
Hmm... not really~ I feel like I mostly just stay in my room after work.
Come on! After work, I'll take you somewhere fun. A romantic moonlit stroll along the beach—doesn't that sound amazing?
Ahaha... If there's no romantic vibe, how will the manager take responsibility?
Then I'll just have to treat you to dinner as compensation.
Deal! I won't go easy on you then~
Finally got a chance to grab dinner with Yuka.
Business at the shop seems to be picking up lately. Have you noticed?
I just started working here, so I can't compare it to before, but it is pretty busy.
Honey, how could a gorgeous girl like you not attract customers?
Haha, really? Then you should give me a raise! I'm practically a walking advertisement now~
Yuka gave me a mischievous smile before heading back to her station.
Hey Yuka, do you ever get tempted by the food while working here? After all, we're a pretty well-known bistro locally.
Hmm~ There are so many dishes I'd love to try! I adore Italian cuisine. But seeing the prices always makes me hesitate...
Oh! Wait—do employees get staff discounts here?
Usually, yes. But after eating here so often, you'll just crave food from outside places.
That's okay! Just let me sample everything I want here first—that'll satisfy me~
Oh, let me let you in on a little secret—you've just met someone pretty amazing. Before I became manager, I was the one in charge of all the food here!
Wow~ Really!?
Yuka looked over with unmistakable excitement, like she'd discovered a new continent.
Tell me what you want to eat when we get back to the dorm today, and I'll cook it for you!
Haha, manager, isn't that sexual harassment?
I leaned closer to Yuka and whispered in a breathy voice.
What are you thinking? I mean, I can make pesto pasta~
Hahaha, you're so annoying~
And just like that, the two of us made plans to have dinner together—and for me to show off my skills.
Yuka, haven't I told you before not to do that?
Waa... Sorry... What did I do wrong?
Can you please not be so captivating while you're working? You know I get distracted easily.
That's your problem!!
Waa... Sorry... Yuka scolded me. What did I do wrong?
Don't copy me!!
Hehe, that felt good.
The manager really loves picking on newbies, huh...
After bantering with Yuka for a bit,
Um... Manager, can I ask you a question?
My measurements? How embarrassing! So you're that direct, huh~
No way, okay?!
What a letdown. So you weren't trying to get to know me better after all...
Hahaha~ You definitely will later~ But seriously... what was I about to ask again...
So I helped Yuka recall what she wanted to ask earlier. Turns out she just wanted to know where I put the pen I took.
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Hearing commotion nearby, I turned to see Yuka seemingly dealing with a troublesome customer.
“Let me handle this. You go take care of the other thing.”
“Is that okay? Thanks, Manager ❤️ I'll go handle the other stuff then~”
Yuka happily ran off.
......And just like that, I got lectured by a difficult customer for five minutes. Where's the dashing hero saving the damsel in distress I was promised...
Manager... This thing is heavy. Could you help me carry it?
No problem, I'll handle it. You just help me move the remaining small items.
You're the best, Manager. Thank you ❤️
So I helped Yuka carry the heavy item to the backstage area, chatting a bit along the way—basically stealing time off the clock.
Watching Yuka scrambling alone at the counter...
Is something wrong? You seem really busy.
Ahaha... Customers keep coming in to order, and the phone keeps ringing with reservation inquiries. Feels like I can't keep up...
Let me handle the menus. I'm faster with those. You take care of incoming calls and follow-up orders.
Really?! That's such a huge help~
Seeing Yuka look so relieved, it seemed she still wasn't fully used to this job yet.
Yuka, do you need any help over there?
Hmm... I'm actually almost done here. Unless new customers come in, I should be able to leave early.
What a coincidence! I just finished my tasks and came to see if you needed any help.
Speaking of bistros, it seems like business is best in the evenings, right?
Yeah, that's why the morning shift is long, but at least it's not as hectic as the night shift.
So I say, wanna take a break?
Seriously... I can't imagine how you became manager...
Haha! I've got skills!
We chatted like this for a while until customers arrived, interrupting our conversation.
Yuka got surrounded by a few guys hitting on her, but they all seemed like familiar faces.
Hey dude~ Long time no see! What brings you here all of a sudden?
Hey! Bro! It really has been ages, haha!
But isn't it a bit much to be hitting on our girl right here on my turf?
Sorry, sorry! But seeing such a cute girl, you just gotta try to get to know her, right?
She's new here and doesn't know anyone. If you scare her off like this, what if she quits?
Haha~ Well, you'll have to introduce her to us sometime then.
I made a gesture and let Yuka leave the area first.
I gotta get back to work...
After chatting for a bit, the group left too. I could feel Yuka staring at me like I was Superman.
Rare day off—why not go out and explore?
That was the plan... but after finishing work, I just collapsed on the couch and couldn't get up.
Delivering food and cleaning aren't exactly grueling, but the long hours really take their toll.
If you're really struggling, just let me know—we've got our part-timer superhero Wang Xiaoming fighting the good fight.
Haha~ You really love joking around, Manager. You must work hard looking after us part-timers too.
It is pretty tough. Today had so many troublesome tasks, but chatting with Yuka made me feel much better.
Me too. Talking with you made my heart feel lighter. I'm so glad you were the first person I met after arriving on the island.
We chatted about some work trivialities and complained together about some really weird customers.
Yuka seems to have brewed some coffee and is resting in the lobby now.
Yuka, did you know? Coffee's most invigorating moment is when it spills on your clothes.
Pfft...!
The sudden lame joke seems to have caught her off guard.
Hahahaha! That's so cold! I thought my dad suddenly started talking.
Seeing you laugh so hard, I bet you actually love these kinds of lame jokes.
Because I never expected the manager to say something like that with a straight face!
Call me Daddy and I'll tell you more of these.
Hahaha, that's your real goal, isn't it~
Even though Yuka never called me Daddy in the end, I still told her a bunch of dad jokes and kept her laughing nonstop.
Manager~ How do you think I did today?
Yuka looks lovely as always.
Huh? That's not what I meant—I was asking about your work performance! But... hehe, I'm so happy.
You've been working really hard. You're getting more and more skilled at your job and helping out so much!
He ruffled Yuka's hair.
Really? That's great! I was worried I might be holding you back. I'm so glad I can be helpful.
Don't worry. Just having you by my side gives me so much support. I really hope we can keep working together forever.
Ah... um...
Yuka hesitated for a moment.
Speaking of which, are you planning to go back after your part-time contract here ends?
Well... that was my original plan.
Waaah... That's so sad. Then I won't get to see Yuka anymore.
After a moment of silence, Yuka quickly returned to her usual self, and they chatted happily for a while.
This is so boring...
So, is there anything you'd like to talk about, Manager?
Good question. Why don't you bring up a topic?
You're the one who wanted to chat, yet now I have to start the conversation!
Now that you mention it, I don't really know what to talk about either...
So, Yuka, do you usually initiate conversations more often, or do you tend to respond passively?
Hmm... I'm usually more passive, unless it's something I really want to share with others—then I'll take the initiative to talk.
I wouldn't have guessed! You seem like the kind of person who's super popular and great at connecting with others.
Hahaha~ So in the manager's eyes, I come across as this sunny, outgoing person?
And just like that, the two of them chatted for a while, starting with topics they didn't quite know how to bring up.
Speaking of which, Yuka looks pretty young. Did you just graduate?
Actually, I graduated from college a year or two ago~
So why did you end up in this godforsaken place?
Well, partly because I wanted to experience a different kind of life~ And...
The cost of living here is super cheap, so it's easy to save money, right?
Huh! How did the manager know that!?... Come to think of it, it makes sense. You must be from around here, right?
Of course! Everyone who comes here to save money ends up blowing it all. Haha, how could they save?
And so, I shared with Yuka many stories of other college students who came here to work and travel but ended up leaving with nothing.
Yuka, are you free tonight?
Hmm... I don't think I am.
Funny, I'm not free either.......

Are you messing with me, Manager?
Hahaha, don't get mad. You look adorable when you're upset, Yuka.
(pinches Yuka's puffed cheeks)
Ugh~ Stop teasing me! Do you pull this move on all the girls, Manager?
No way, I only do this with Yuka.
We chatted and teased each other for a while, but when the topic turned to relationships, Yuka awkwardly dodged it. It felt like she was hiding something.
Who knew Yuka was such a hard worker...
Yuka lay sprawled on the sofa, looking at me with confusion, clearly unsure of the situation.
“You actually wear makeup in the dorm too?!”
“Hehe, what do you think of my makeup today, Manager?”
“It's cute, but I'm not happy at all.”
“Why?”
“A girl this cute should already have a boyfriend! It's so unfair!”
“Haha, it's an honor to get compliments from the Manager~ But you got all your guesses wrong~”
Huh? Which part?!
After that, Yuka steered the conversation elsewhere. From what I could gather, it seemed highly likely she didn't have a boyfriend. Looks like I've got a whole bunch of rivals instead of just one...
The weather's so nice today, it'd be a shame not to go out. Yuka, wanna hang out with me?
Hmm... It's so hot... Going out feels like such a hassle...
How about I treat you to dinner instead?
I just ate~ No thanks, lounging here with the AC is way more comfy. Sorry, Boss, I can't keep you company~
We could wait until later when it cools down! Imagine eating snacks under the stars—doesn't that sound incredibly romantic?
That sounds like a recipe for weight gain. Besides, if you want to take me out, you'll have to beat this couch first! I'm so tired... I really don't feel like going out...
I've got an idea—how about we go to my room? It's still within the dorm grounds. Isn't that a great suggestion?
Hahaha, that joke's a bit much~ Who tries to kidnap someone the moment they arrive? Are you some creepy uncle the manager warned us about?
Then tell me what we can actually do!
That's how Yuka and I brainstormed places to hang out, though in the end, we all just stayed cozy in the dorm room with the AC blasting.
Waaah... I'm so hungry...
What's wrong?
I suddenly really want something to eat... But I ate all the snacks and I'm too lazy to go out.
Eat me.......

Alright, tell me what you want to eat. I was thinking of grabbing something too.
Really!? Thank you so much!
Hehe, no big deal. So when do you want to head out?
Huh? I thought I could just stay on the couch...
Yuka looked at me with sparkling eyes.
And I thought I'd be going out to eat with Yuka, but somehow I ended up being her late-night delivery guy.
It seems like Yuka's room is always pretty noisy around bedtime...
...!
As if afraid of being caught doing something, Yuka stared straight at me.
Could there be mice or cockroaches here?
Haha, it's not that bad~ Though cockroaches do show up occasionally.
If you have any problems, just let me know! Just yell my name and I'll rush over to your room for backup.
I'll only call you if cockroaches or mice come out~ Otherwise, you shouldn't need me.
Are you underestimating my service range?
Hehe, next time there's a cockroach, I'll definitely call you~
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
Ugh! Where is the manager looking again?!
This is a special fruit from our island—sweet and easy to eat. Would you like to try some?
Ah... it's okay... I don't really drink much. I can just watch you drink from the side...
So I chatted with Yuka while sipping a little drink.
Having a drink and chatting after work is so relaxing. Want to join me for a glass?
Wah, I'm not much of a drinker. I can't keep up with you for long, but I can definitely keep you company while we chat~
So we chatted and sipped drinks together.
Is that liquor on the table? The packaging looks pretty fancy...
This is a pretty famous fruit wine from our island. I'm good friends with the distillery owner, and we get a lot of our stock from them. Want to try some?
I don't really drink much, haha... Who knows what I'd do if I got drunk.
Oh? Could Yuka be the type to lose control when drunk? I'd love to see that...
Seriously, is the shopkeeper thinking weird thoughts right now?!
Yuka hadn't even had a sip, yet her cheeks were flushed bright red.
So we chatted with Yuka while sipping lightly.
After pouring the liquor into a cup, I capped it and began spinning it vigorously.
Slowly, the bottle's opening turned toward Yuka. She stared at the spinning bottle on the table, puzzled, wondering what was happening.
Truth or Dare!
Ah... Huh!?... Truth...?
Hmm... Got it! What does Yuka think of my look?
Hahaha... Is it too late to choose Truth or Dare now?
And so Yuka circled the living room five times with a bottle of fruit wine balanced on her head.
By the way, does Yuka ever get hungry looking at customers' food while working?
Hehe, of course! So much of it looks delicious here~
Let me tell you a secret—the one I'm drinking right now is from the priciest row on the menu!
Huh!? Does that mean the manager is super rich too?
Of course I just took it home! But the boss doesn't seem to mind. Want a sip?
Eh... it's fine~ You drink up, Manager~
So I chatted with Yuka while sipping a little.
Damn... Kill me... If there were more girls in the shop, I might feel better...
Look on the bright side... At least I learned my lesson and went to bed early yesterday...
I should've told that old man to hire another part-timer. Then I could sleep in every day.
Damn... God, I don't want to stay here another minute...
playerName…You can do it! Today's the last day!
Awesome! It's the weekend—time to chill out and enjoy a day of pure bliss!
Finally off work—my shift's over and it's my turn to enjoy myself.
Got it~ Once I finish up here, I can hand over my shift~
After completing the handover, I headed back to the dorm.
Not really sure what to do anyway, so I just lazed around in bed and the day slipped by.
Pretty tired today—better get some rest early.
It's getting late—if I don't sleep now, I won't be able to get up tomorrow.
Probably shouldn't wander into other people's rooms unless I have to.
Save completed!
